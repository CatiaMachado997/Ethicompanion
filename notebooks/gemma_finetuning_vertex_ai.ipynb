    "Congratulations! You've successfully fine-tuned a Gemma model for ethical guidance.\n",
    "\n",
    "### What you accomplished:\n",
    "- ✅ Created a structured ethical guidance dataset\n",
    "- ✅ Fine-tuned Gemma using LoRA for parameter efficiency\n",
    "- ✅ Tracked training with Weights & Biases\n",
    "- ✅ Tested the fine-tuned model\n",
    "- ✅ Saved the model for deployment\n",
    "\n",
    "### Next Steps:\n",
    "1. **Expand Dataset**: Create a larger, more diverse training dataset\n",
    "2. **Hyperparameter Tuning**: Experiment with different learning rates, batch sizes\n",
    "3. **Evaluation Metrics**: Implement comprehensive evaluation metrics\n",
    "4. **A/B Testing**: Compare with base models in production\n",
    "5. **Continuous Learning**: Implement feedback loops for model improvement\n",
    "\n",
    "### Integration with EthicCompanion:\n",
    "- Update your `llm_service_enhanced.py` to use this fine-tuned model\n",
    "- Implement model versioning and A/B testing\n",
    "- Monitor performance in production"
