      "📝 Response: Hi there!  Navigating the world of news and information can be tricky, especially with so much available online.  Fortunately, AI can be a helpful companion in this journey.  Here are three practical tips to use AI ethically and effectively to improve your information consumption:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Use AI to cross-reference sources and identify bias:**  Don't rely on a single news article or social media post.  If you find a piece of information that seems important, use an AI-powered tool (many are freely available online) to quickly find similar stories from a range of sources.  This helps you see different perspectives and identify potential biases. For example, you could feed a headline into an AI summarizer and then ask it to find similar articles from various news organizations – comparing their takes can offer a richer understanding.  Remember, AI tools aren't perfect, but they can significantly boost your fact-checking efficiency.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Employ AI to evaluate source credibility:**  AI can assist in assessing the credibility of a news source.  Many AI-powered tools analyze websites and articles for factors like author expertise, fact-checking history, and potential conflicts of interest.  This doesn't guarantee perfect accuracy, but it provides valuable clues about a source's trustworthiness – helping you decide how much weight to give to the information presented.  Think of it as a helpful second opinion when researching unfamiliar sources.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **Leverage AI to personalize your news diet, but with caution:**  AI-powered news aggregators can curate news based on your interests, which is convenient.  However, be mindful of the potential for filter bubbles.  Actively seek out diverse perspectives, even if they challenge your existing viewpoints. Use AI to broaden your horizons, not to reinforce pre-existing biases.  Periodically search for news topics outside your usual comfort zone – this keeps your understanding well-rounded and prevents an echo chamber effect.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Remember, AI is a tool; its effectiveness depends on how you use it.  By being thoughtful and critical in your approach, you can leverage AI's power to become a more informed and ethically engaged news consumer.  Good luck, and happy researching!\n",

    "## 📋 **Two Setup Methods**\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Method 1: Google Cloud Console** (Easiest - 2 minutes)\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Open Google Cloud Console**\n",
    "   - Go to: https://console.cloud.google.com\n",
    "   - Select your project: `ethiccompanion-prod`\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Navigate to Gemini Admin**\n",
    "   - Search for \"Admin for Gemini\" in the console\n",
    "   - Or go to: https://console.cloud.google.com/admin/gemini\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Enable Data Sharing**\n",
    "   - Click on **Settings** page\n",
    "   - Find **\"Turn on data sharing\"** option\n",
    "   - Click to enable sharing of prompts and responses with Google\n",
    "   - Confirm the setting\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Method 2: Programmatic Setup** (Advanced)\n",
    "\n",
    "We'll set this up using the Google Cloud API programmatically in the cells below.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## ⚠️ **Important Notes**\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Data Sharing**: This allows Google to use your prompts/responses to improve Gemini\n",
    "- **Required for API Access**: Without this, many Gemini API features won't work\n",
    "- **Project-wide**: This setting applies to all Gemini users in your project\n",
    "- **Can be disabled**: You can turn this off later if needed\n",
